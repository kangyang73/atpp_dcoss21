## 1. AppReceiver
* It is the project of Android mobile application implementation.
* You need to use Android Studio 3.x to open this project.
* The main file is located in ./AppReceiver/app/src/main/java/com/danielchen/demo/appreceiver/MainActivity.java

******
## 2. AppTimePre

* It is the project of algorithm implementation.
* The main file is located in ./AppTimePre/src/run.py

### 2.1 Datasets
We release the anonymized sample data for the evauluation.

* `apps-train.txt` : userID|appID1|appID2...

* `locations-train.txt` : userID|location1|location2...

* `times-train.txt` : userID|time1|time2...

* `apps-test.txt` : userID|appID1|appID2...

* `locations-test.txt` : userID|location1|location2...

* `times-test.txt` : userID|time1|time2...
 

### 2.2 Dependencies
The following modules are needed.

- `Ubuntu 16.04`
- `Python >=3.5`
- `Tensorflow >=1.x`

### 2.3 Execution
```
$ python run.py ../data/apps-train.txt ../data/locations-train.txt ../data/times-train.txt ../data/apps-test.txt ../data/locations-test.txt ../data/times-test.txt 
```
